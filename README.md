# Data Analysis Tool

This data analysis tool is developed using Python and popular libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It enables you to analyze and visualize datasets, providing insightful information through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- Data loading: Load data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON.
- Data exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, such as summary statistics, data types, and missing values.
- Data visualization: Generate visualizations, including bar plots, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms, to visualize patterns and relationships within the data.
- Customization: Customize the visualizations by specifying plot titles, axis labels, color schemes, and other parameters.
- Export options: Export the generated visualizations as image files (PNG, JPEG) for further use and sharing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
